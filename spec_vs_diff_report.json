  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements substantially. REQ-1 backend is fully implemented with all five calculation methods. REQ-2 frontend calculator UI is complete with all four shapes, validation, and results display. REQ-3 PWA configuration is present with manifest, service worker, and index.html meta tags. REQ-4 earthy-green OKLCH theme, sticky header, mobile-first layout, tips, formula reference, unit conversions, and footer are all implemented. One minor discrepancy: the manifest.json references icon filenames differing from the requested image filenames, but this is an asset naming issue rather than a missing feature. The tailwind.config.js uses hsl() wrappers for several color tokens instead of oklch(), partially contradicting REQ-4, but the CSS custom properties themselves are defined in OKLCH.",

      "description": "Perimeter-only calculation mode as a separate UI flow with its own PerimeterInputs component",
      "reason": "The build request specifies a backend method for perimeter calculation but the frontend requirement only describes four shape options in the calculator UI (rectangle, square, irregular, rotation-based). The diff adds a dedicated PerimeterInputs component used in FieldCalculator as an additional calculation mode beyond the four requested shapes.",
